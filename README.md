# PyTesseract
Language detection,extract text and images from DOCX,XLSX,PDF,JPEG,PNG,BMP and GIF files through PyTesseract. This repository also includes calculating hash and metadata of a given file.I've developed this project on Linux Ubuntu 18.04,through Python 2.7 version which already comes with Ubuntu. You can also get the codes for text extraction through OpenCV as a comment under the given Python codes.

You can get more details about Google's Tesseract project here :

# How to Setup Tesseract

This part will take long a bit due to many dependencies of Tesseract. First of all, I am going to give you another Github page that you can find detailed explanations in terms of your OS:
